To download or clone Drupal themes from Git with a specific version (like `8.x-3.x`) within a `Dockerfile`, you'll use the `git clone` command and then `git checkout` the desired version.

Here's how you can integrate that into your `Dockerfile`, assuming you're building upon a Drupal image and `git` is already installed (as per our previous conversation):

```dockerfile
# Start from your custom Drupal image where Git is installed
# FROM my-drupal-app:latest # (If you built one with git already installed)
FROM drupal:latest # Or the specific base image you're using if starting fresh

# --- Install Git (if not already in your base image) ---
# Ensure git is installed in the container
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends git && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# --- Clone and Checkout Drupal Theme ---
# Set the working directory to where Drupal themes typically reside
WORKDIR /var/www/html/themes/contrib

# Clone the theme repository
# Replace 'your_theme_name' with the actual theme directory name.
# Replace 'https://git.drupalcode.org/project/bootstrap.git' with the actual Git URL of your theme.
# For Drupal.org projects, the URL format is typically 'https://git.drupalcode.org/project/<project_name>.git'
RUN git clone https://git.drupalcode.org/project/bootstrap.git your_theme_name

# Change into the cloned theme directory
WORKDIR /var/www/html/themes/contrib/your_theme_name

# Checkout the specific version (branch or tag)
# Replace '8.x-3.x' with your desired branch, tag, or commit hash.
# For stable releases, you might use a tag like '8.x-3.0' or '8.x-3.2'
# For active development, you might use a branch name like '8.x-3.x'
RUN git checkout 8.x-3.x

# --- Final Cleanup (Optional but Recommended) ---
# Remove the .git directory to reduce the final image size.
# This makes the image smaller as you don't need the Git history for runtime.
WORKDIR /var/www/html/themes/contrib
RUN rm -rf your_theme_name/.git

# --- Set permissions if necessary ---
# Ensure the files are owned by the web server user (www-data on Debian-based images)
# This is important for Drupal to properly access theme files.
RUN chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/themes/contrib/your_theme_name

# --- Clear Drupal Cache (important after adding new themes) ---
# Switch to the web server user (www-data) before running drush
USER www-data
RUN drush cache:rebuild
# If 'drush' is not globally available or configured, you might need to specify its path:
# RUN php /var/www/html/vendor/bin/drush cache:rebuild

# Switch back to root if subsequent commands require it
# USER root

# Keep the original CMD/ENTRYPOINT of the base Drupal image
```

### Explanation:

1.  **`FROM drupal:latest`**: Starts your image from the base Drupal image. If you've already built a custom image that includes `git`, you can replace this with `FROM my-drupal-app:latest`.
2.  **`RUN apt-get update ... install git ...`**: This ensures that `git` is available in your container to perform the cloning operation. If your base image (or a previous custom image) already has `git` installed, you can omit this step.
3.  **`WORKDIR /var/www/html/themes/contrib`**: This command changes the current working directory inside the Docker image to where Drupal's contributed themes are typically installed.
4.  **`RUN git clone <repo_url> your_theme_name`**:
    * `git clone`: Downloads the entire Git repository.
    * `<repo_url>`: This is the URL of your Git repository. For themes hosted on Drupal.org, it usually follows the format `https://git.drupalcode.org/project/<project_name>.git` (e.g., `https://git.drupalcode.org/project/bootstrap.git` for the Bootstrap theme).
    * `your_theme_name`: This is the directory name that the theme will be cloned into. It should match the machine name of your theme (e.g., `bootstrap`).
5.  **`WORKDIR /var/www/html/themes/contrib/your_theme_name`**: Changes into the newly cloned theme directory. This is necessary before running `git checkout`.
6.  **`RUN git checkout 8.x-3.x`**:
    * `git checkout`: Switches to a specific branch, tag, or commit.
    * `8.x-3.x`: This is the branch name that represents the 8.x-3.x development line. If you want a specific stable release, you'd use a tag like `8.x-3.2`. If you have a specific commit hash, you can use that too.
7.  **`RUN rm -rf your_theme_name/.git`**: After checking out the desired version, the entire Git history (`.git` directory) is no longer needed for the runtime image. Removing it significantly reduces the final image size.
8.  **`RUN chown -R www-data:www-data ...`**: Ensures that the web server user (`www-data` on Debian-based images) has the correct ownership of the theme files, which is crucial for Drupal to function correctly.
9.  **`USER www-data` / `RUN drush cache:rebuild`**: It's good practice to switch to the `www-data` user to run `drush` commands, as this mirrors how the web server will interact with Drupal. Clearing the cache is essential after adding new themes or modules for Drupal to recognize them.

Remember to replace placeholders like `your_theme_name`, `https://git.drupalcode.org/project/bootstrap.git`, and the exact `git checkout` version with your actual theme details.
